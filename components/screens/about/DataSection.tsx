        <Title order={5}>Data Scraping</Title>
        COH3 does not provide Live Games API as in COH2. We are unable to track live games, and
        therefore all the games played on the platform as we do on coh2stats.com.
        <br />
        We are able to track only matches, where there is at least one player who has changed his
        rank.
        <br />
        Such matches are ingested into the system and counted in the stats.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can download the data we are scraping. More info on{" "}
        <Anchor href={getOpenDataRoute()}> Open Data</Anchor> page.

      <Title order={5}>Explorer</Title>
      All the data for units, DPS calculators, faction overviews are generated directly from the
      game files. There are often a bugs in the COH source files, please report any problems you
      find to us. Thank you
