### The idea of the screens folder

It's getting quite messy in the components folders.
The idea is to split this into components and screens.

- Components, are things which are used on various pages in the app
- Screens folder, mimics the structure in the pages' folder.
  We have here the main component for those screens, but it can be also split
  into multiple files. Thus grouping all that shit together.
