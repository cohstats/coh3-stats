## Project
- We are using `yarn` as our package manager.

## React component development
- When developing new component which has low amount of props, try to do inline types instead of creating new interface.

## Localization
- When developing localization, always try to pass `TFunction` as component prop instead of utilize useTranslation hook.
  - useTranslation hook should be utilized only in the top level components (pages, modals, etc.) if possible
- The folder with locales the en folder is the source of through. When adding adding keys always add keys there first.
- The locale folder is in public/locales/en with .json file in it
- When translating other languages, do not translate locales which don't have locale folder created yet.
