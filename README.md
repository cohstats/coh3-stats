## COH3 Stats technology stack

App platform:

- Firebase

Frontend:

- NextJS (React) as main technology used
- Edgio as a hosting platform
- Mantine as a component library

Backend:

- GCP Cloud
- Firebase Cloud Functions - in TypeScript
- Database:
  - Firestore - for basic data
  - Other DB? We might need a different DB for storing the info - as we might expect high amount of reads / writes -- not perfect for FireStore
  - Big Query - for stored matches (we need to do pricing calculations on this)
